# RaMP Relational Database of Metabolomic Pathways
Metabolomics involves the systematic study of all metabolites (metabolome) measured in biospecimens such as cells, tissues, and biofluids. Metabolomics plays a critical role in translational research, and interpretation of metabolomics data contributes to better understanding of cellular biology and genomics.

However, functional interpretation of disease-associated metabolites is challenging, and the connection between biological mechanisms and disease-specific metabolomics profiles are usually unknown. Further ,publicly available metabolomics data are generally sparse, and either alone cannot provide comprehensive analysis. 

Because an integrated database is not readily available for download and integration with other web tools,we developed RaMP (Relational databases of Metabolomics Pathway) by integrating metabolite/protein/gene biological pathways from publicly available databases. To use and query RaMP, we have developed an R package with associated Rshiny app. The user-friendly web app enables complex queries, statistical analyses, and interactive plots of results to aid intepretation of metabolomics data.<br />
